Uses pretrained ResNet50 model
Implements data augmentation (flips, rotations, color jitter)
Saves the best model based on validation accuracy
Creates training history plots
Uses GPU if available
Implements proper train/validation split
The script will:

Load and preprocess your data
Train the model for 10 epochs
Save the best model as 'best_model.pth'
Generate a training history plot as 'training_history.png'
